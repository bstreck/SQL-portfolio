##We've created a database for customers and their orders. Not all of the customers have made orders, however. Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made. Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.
