##We've created a database for customers and their orders. Note, not all of the customers 
have made orders.

##Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every
 customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made. Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN 
 so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any 
 ORDER BY.

##Create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, 
 email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders. Sort the rows according to 
 the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.
