##We've created a database of clothes, and decided we need a price column.  Use ALTER to add a 'price' column to the table.  Then select all the columns in each row to see what your table looks like now.

##Now assign each item a price, using UPDATE - item 1 should be 10 dollars, item 2  should be 20 dollars, item 3 should be 30 dollars. When you're done, do another  SELECT of all the rows to check that it worked as expected

##Now insert a new item into the table that has all three attributes filled in,  including 'price'. Do one final SELECT of all the rows to check it worked
