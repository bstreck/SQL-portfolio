##We've created a database for a documents app, with rows for each document with it's 
title, content, and author.

##Use UPDATE to change the author to 'Jackie Draper' for all rows where it's currently 'Jackie Paper'. Then re-select all the rows to make sure the table changed like you expected.

##Now you'll delete a row, being very careful not to delete all the rows. Only delete  the row where the title is 'Things I'm Afraid Of'. Then re-select all the rows to make sure the table changed like you expected.
