--Find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group, filtering for the most recent year in the database. The query should return three columns: industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint, with the last column being rounded to one decimal place. The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest values.--

SELECT industry_group, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT(company)) AS num_companies, 
	ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf),1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
WHERE product_emissions.year IN 
	(SELECT MAX(year)
	FROM public.product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;


--Which industry has the largest total carbon footprint PCF? Return the year, industry, number of unique companies, and total carbon footprint PCF rounded to 2 places.--

SELECT year,
	industry_group, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT(company)) AS num_companies, 
	ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf),2) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
GROUP BY industry_group, year
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC
